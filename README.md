## Dataset Details
The UGIAD-Seg dataset provides open access to 3313 UGI endoscopic images from Macao Kiang Wu Hospital and Xiangyang Centre Hospital, mainly captured using WLE and partly by NBI. These images encompass three key areas: esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, each annotated with specific anatomical landmarks and disease types, and these annotations are both applied and subsequently verified by medical specialists from the two contributing hospitals. The dataset is developed ensuring patient anonymity and privacy, with all materials fully anonymized by excluding patient information from the images and renaming the files according to their anatomical landmark and disease labels, and thereby exempting it from patient consent requirements. The images consist of different resolutions that range between 268x217 and 1545x1156 with most of the black borders removed. 
The dataset can also be downloaded using the following links: <br />

### Anatomical landmark annotation
Our anatomical annotation approach is guided by previous photodocumentation guidelines such as the British and Japanese guidelines. The images are categorised into 9 landmarks. Anatomical landmarks identified in the antegrade view within the UGIAD dataset encompass the esophagus (E), squamocolumnar junction (SJ), gastric body in antegrade view (Ba), antrum (Ant), duodenal bulb (DB) and descending part of the duodenum (DD). Conversely, the retroflex view encompasses landmarks such as the fundus (F), gastric body in retroflex view (Br) and angulus (Ang).

### Disease annotation
For disease annotation, the images in the dataset are classified into normal findings or 8 upper gastrointestinal (UGI) diseases including esophageal neoplasm, esophageal varices, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric neoplasm, gastric polyp, gastric ulcer, gastric varices, and duodenal ulcer.
